# Setting Up Wazuh System
Setting up Wazuh IDS contains mainly 2 parts :
1. Wazuh Server
2. Wazuh Agent

The **Wazuh Server** acts as the central management and processing hub, collecting, analyzing, and storing security data from various sources, including Wazuh agents and external logs, to provide comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities.

**Wazuh Agents** are lightweight, deployed on endpoint devices, and tasked with collecting and forwarding local logs, system metrics, and security events to the Wazuh server for centralized analysis and alerting.
